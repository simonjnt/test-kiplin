# Kiplin Backend Technical Test

Welcome to this test!

## Context
This is a todo-list application, which is using the hexagonal architecture.

If this is the first time you hear about this architectural pattern, it aims to separate domain concepts (related to the business) from infrastructure concerns (related to technical details).

The rules of this pattern are:
  - Code living in the `Domain` namespace MUST NOT depend on external system (filesystem, clock, network, ...)
  - Code living in the `Domain` namespace MUST NOT be context specific (can only run in a web or a cli context, for instance)
  - Code that requires the previous dependencies MUST live in the `Infrastructure` namespace
  - `Domain` classes MUST NOT depend on `Infrastructure` classes
  - `Infrastructure` classes CAN depend on `Domain` classes

Furthermore, we have chosen to split read and write concerns (aka the CQRS pattern) by defining multiple repository interfaces. Check the `App\Domain\TodoRepository` and `App\Application\TodosRepository` to learn more about their contract.

## Running the app
For now, the app has no contact with the outside world (no shiny UI, no fancy responsive design, ...).

However, you may test your implementations thanks to carefully designed integration tests.

To launch the test suite, you need to run

```
$ make test
```

## Mission
Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to implement a read and a write repository with the backend storage technology of your choice. It could be, but is not limited to, a RDBMS. You may implement both interfaces within the same class.

We provide you with an in-memory implementation, as an example!

You will use git to log the history of your implementation.

The testsuite must pass by simply running `make all`.

You will add a README explaining your storage choice, along with any modifications or suggestions you have or would have done to the codebase.

We recommend documenting any extra work you would have performed.

At the end of the exercise, archive your project, including the `.git` directory and excluding the `vendor` directory.

You may now send it to your Kiplin contact, and we will get in touch soon!

Thanks!
